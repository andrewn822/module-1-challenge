# module-1-challenge

## Description

This homework module 1 was designed for us to start with a starter code and our mission is to modify the code so that we meet the required acceptance critieria. I decide to work on this project to help me understand more about html and css as well as cleaning up code. Making the code look clean and more acceptable in a professional setting. It helps with learning html semantics, applying css properly, changing code so thats its more efficent and less scattered, also organizing code neatly.
